"Hey Bob, how are you?"
Bob was powerless up against such a question.
He did not know how he was.
He did not know who he was.
He did not know where he was.
He did not know why he was.
He did not know when he was.
He only knew one thing, and that was that he existed as Bob.
So Bob did not respond to his cat.
